Need a hand with your Mirth (NextGen Connect) work? Come check out our list of consultants!

## Overview

Over on [slack](https://mirthconnect.slack.com), we've had lots of people come knocking and needing various Mirth work done. Since then, we've decided to create this helpful list.

If you'd like to be listed, please open a PR or message me on slack (@rogin) with the following:

1. Company Name
1. your preferred company URL
1. languages other than English you can cater
1. a line or two blurb on what you focus on / specific sector(s) / sell yourself
1. [optional] Country of origin and/or areas you would like to help (e.g. U.S. and E.U.)
1. [optional, but recommended] a slack name to @ when someone knocks

Right now they're to be ordered alphabetically on Company Name, but that may change.

## The List

TODO: fill me in!
